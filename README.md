# Weather-App
In this project, I will be attempting to fetch weather data from an API called OpenWeatherMap. After fetching the data, I will use HTML, CSS, and JS to display them in a readable way. 

I fetched data from 2 different APIs: OpenWeatherMap and GIPHY API. One for the GIF and one for the 
weather.
